        <h1> Designing The datastory</h1>
        During the semester in 3844 I worked on three separate projects. The
        first was a collection of data, the second was an explained video on
      pandoras music genome, and the third was this very website. Thanks to a
      very patient teacher, and a lot of blood sweat and tears, I was able to successfully
      create my own website that I am very proud of

        Here is where I began my project. Over the course of 5 days I tracked
        where and what I listened to. The main point of the project was to see
        what I listened to while at the gym vs when im studying.
      </p>
      <p> What i found is that I tend to listen to certain genres more when im studying
        vs when Im at the gym. For example, I listen to Pop more while im studying, and
        I listen to Rap more while im working out.

    In the end I am really proud of the final product. It took a lot of blood sweat and tears,
    but I finished, and I am happy with what I finished with. I hope to use this knowledge
    for next semester, and maybe even in my future career.
