        <h1> Designing The datastory</h1>
        During the semester in 3844 I worked on three separate projects. The
        first was a collection of data, the second was an explained video on
      pandoras music genome, and the third was this very website. If has not
      already been made abundantly clear, I am not a coder. In fact, this is my fisrt foray
      into the world of coding. HTML and CSS might as well be a foreign language
      to me. That being said, I am very proud of what I have created over the
      semester. It may not be the prettiest, or the most creative, or even the
      most well put together, but it is something I spent weeks on, and im proud
      to say I created it. This is thanks to a great teacher, who
      was more than happy to help whenever it was needed, and has the patience
      of a saint. Thank you Dr. Lindgren.

        Here is where I began my project. Over the course of 5 days i tracked
        where and what i listened to. The main point of the project was to see
        what I listened to while at the gym vs when im studying.

         What I found from this data is that i tend to study more at night, and
         go to the gym in the morning. I also found that I listen to pop music a lot
         more when I study, and rap or R&B while im at the gym. This came as a surprise
         to me because I like to think of myself as a hipster, and the amount of
         mainstream pop music I listen to disturbs me. I also saw that I actually
         listen to a wider ranger of genres whilst im studying, compared to
         when I'm at the gym I only listen to 1 or 2 genres.

        This project was more researched based than the first. For this project
        I decided to look the Pandora algorithim that reccomends music to its listeners
        .This is known as the Pandora Music Genome. It is an actually very complex
        algorithim that gathers the types of music people listen to, and tries to
        reccomend genres, songs, or artists a person maight like based on what they
        like, or what they've listened to in the past. As you will be able to see in my explained video
        Pandora goes the extra mile to reccomend music that its listeners will actually
        want to listen to. The music genome, according to Pandoras CEO, is only just getting started. The compnay hopes
        to take music listening to another level, especially for its premium listeners.

  By the end of this semester I learned how to make a video using apple movie
  maker, and perhaps my biggest accomplishment, was learing how to code my own
  website. I hope to use this knowledge in future classes, and maybe even in my
  own career some day. All in all I really enjoyed my experience in 3844. I learned
  a lot, and though it was a lot of work, I am really glad I powered through and
  finished with something I can be proud of.
